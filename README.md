# AirBnB_data
With the AirBnB_data project I am pulling data from InsideAirBnB.com. Since I live in Denver,CO I wanted to use it as the location for analysis. Now I am trying to answer 3 questions with the data: 1) Who are the top monthly earners? 2) Who are the top yearly earners? 3) Which hosts have the most "dirty reviews"? 

I am trying to decide if I should host my house on AirBnB and wanted to see how much money could be earned on a monthly &/or yearly basis. For the dirty reviews portion, we have a lovely janitor at my current occupation that I wanted to see if I could help them with their personal business! This project is just for fun, to answer a few questions I had about AirBnB's and the host earnings.
