# AirBnB_data
With the AirBnB_data project I am pulling data from InsideAirBnB.com. Since I live in Denver,CO I wanted to use it as the location for our analysis. Now I am trying to answer 3 questions with the data: 1) Who are the top monthly earners? 2) Who are the top yearly earners? 3) Which hosts have the most "dirty reviews"?
